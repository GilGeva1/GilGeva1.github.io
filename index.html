		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>This repository presents research on "Binaural sound source localization using a hybrid time and frequency domain model". The study was conducted as part of a thesis for Reichman University in collaboration with IRCAM Institute. It has been accepted for presentation at the IEEE conference ICASSP 2024. Included in this repository are an overview of the research, images illustrating data collection at Reichman University and IRCAM Institute, and a description of the model architecture. Additionally, HRIR files for each ear of every speaker in IRCAM are provided. Furthermore, there is a .py file containing the code and other tools for data processing. Moreover, it contains the thesis document, the presentation used for the thesis defense, the conference paper, and a citation for reference.</p>

		<h2>Abstract</h2>
		<p>Sound source localization plays a foundational role in auditory perception, enabling both human and machines to determine the sound source location. Traditional sound localization methods often rely on manually crafted features and simplified conditions, which limit their applicability in real-world situations. Accurate sound localization holds vital importance across diverse applications, spanning robotics, virtual reality, human-computer interactions, and medical devices. This significance is particularly amplified for individuals with cochlear implants (CI), who confront significant challenges in perceiving the direction of sound sources...</p>
